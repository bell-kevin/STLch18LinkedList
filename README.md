# STLch18LinkedList

In the book, table 18-2 lists several functions for the STL list container. Write a project to practice several of those functions.

Ask the user to enter positive integers. They need to be in sorted order, with some duplicates in the input. See the image below. Use a sentinel to end the input when the user enters 0 or a negative number. Push each value at the end of the list. Display the list and report its size. Use the unique function to remove the duplicates, then display the list again and report on its size. Ask the user for a second list of integers, pushing them into that second list, until the user enters the sentinel. This list must also be sorted. Use the merge function to combine the two lists. Display the result and report on its size.

Here is an example of the execution of the program. Note that there are duplicates in the first list.

Take a screenshot of the result.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
